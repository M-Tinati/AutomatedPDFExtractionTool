# PDF Download Script

This is a Python script designed to automatically detect and download all PDF files from a given web page.

By providing the URL of a website, the script scans the HTML content of the page, finds all links that end with `.pdf`, and downloads those files into a local folder (default name: `pdf_files`).

This tool is especially useful when you need to download multiple PDF files from a page without doing it manually â€” for example, pages containing articles, reports, forms, or educational materials.
